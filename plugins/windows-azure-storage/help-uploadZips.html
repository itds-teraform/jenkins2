	If checked, a zipped up archive will be uploaded to blob storage.  This archive (named archive.zip in the root 
	of the container + virtual path) contains all of the files that are uploaded.  Note that if you only upload the zip by checking
	"Do not upload individual files", then the blob storage download build step cannot selectively download the uploaded blobs.
	You must instead download the whole archive.zip and unzip it yourself.
